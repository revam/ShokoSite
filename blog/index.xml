Its also important to note that not everything we discuss or bring up on Discord in regards to new features and improvements are actually planned for implementation. Sometimes its nothing more than just brainstorming and gauging reactions to said idea.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Version 3.9.5 Released</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-9-5-released/</link><pubDate>Mon, 22 Jul 2019 19:42:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-9-5-released/</guid><description>Shoko Version 3.9.5 is now available for download!

In the past to save time, we used a prebuilt template and customized it to our needs. While this worked in the beginning, we found that trying to add or modify the template outside of its designed purpose would cause issues.</description></item><item><title>Kyoto Animation Fire</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/kyoto-animation-fire/</link><pubDate>Thu, 18 Jul 2019 19:42:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/kyoto-animation-fire/</guid><description>As many of you have probably already heard, Kyoto Animation, creators of such anime as Miss Kobayashi&amp;rsquo;s Dragon Maid, The Melancholy of Haruhi Suzumiya, and A Silent Voice suffered a horrific arson attack yesterday that killed 33 people, with many more injured.

While some members of our team having been working away on fixing issues created by the move to .NET Standard, we also started a side-project to create design and create a brand new website for Shoko.

This releases address some long-standing issues and new issues created during various updates that were made to Shoko Server since the last My Anime 3 which was almost a year ago.

This release contains a lot of new and updated features and bug fixes making it one of our biggest updates in quite some time. While we initially tried to stay away from big releases, some outside factors such as MAL unexpectedly shutting down their API (more below) and our revamped TvDB Linking System delayed this release.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Version 3.8.3 Released</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-8-3-released/</link><pubDate>Sun, 04 Feb 2018 01:06:21 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-8-3-released/</guid><description>This release will be the last release for version 3.8 as we&amp;rsquo;re starting to work on some major internal changes that we&amp;rsquo;ve been planning for awhile.

Version 3.8 was our biggest release to date and was released a very long time after Version 3.7. We&amp;rsquo;ve decided that going forward we&amp;rsquo;re going to aim for releasing updates at least once a month to ease migration for current users and reduce the amount of testing needed beforehand. We&amp;rsquo;ve also made some changes to our versioning system which we&amp;rsquo;ve outlined below.</description></item><item><title>Anime Buddy Discontinued</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/anime-buddy-discontinued/</link><pubDate>Sat, 16 Sep 2017 03:10:11 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/anime-buddy-discontinued/</guid><description>Over the past couple of months, we&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about the development status of Anime Buddy. While we originally intended to keep updating it, multiple issues have made this near impossible for us without essentially creating a brand-new program.

While we’ve added quite a few new features, fixed a lot of bugs and updated a lot of existing features and functionality, the main reason this release took longer than usual is due to the giant refactoring we did on the Shoko codebase. The great thing about this refactor is that everyone benefits from it.</description></item><item><title>Shoko Version 3.8 Beta</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-8-beta/</link><pubDate>Tue, 25 Jul 2017 21:32:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/shoko-version-3-8-beta/</guid><description>Hello Everyone!
After seven months of development, we&amp;rsquo;re close to releasing the next version of Shoko, Version 3.8! Looking back at our past releases, this upcoming version is by far the biggest release we&amp;rsquo;ve done so far. However with that being said, Version 3.8 is not really as feature packed as one might think based off the claim I just made, instead the majority of work has been to optimizing Server and Desktop code as these are essential to our overall goal of making Shoko Server cross-platform and the building of the new Shoko Desktop, currently codename ClientV2.</description></item><item><title>Announcing a New Plugin - ShokoMetadata</title><link>https://shokoanime.com/blog/announcing-a-new-plugin-shokometadata/</link><pubDate>Sun, 12 Mar 2017 04:15:48 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://shokoanime.com/blog/announcing-a-new-plugin-shokometadata/</guid><description>For the last couple of weeks, Cazzar has been working on a new Plex plugin called, Shoko Metadata.
There recently has been the release for version 1.0.0 as this has been deemed the latest stable version working alongside Shoko Server 3.7.0.4. Though at the time of writing, the current version has little documentation due to being an early release.

While originally scheduled for earlier this month, Shoko Version 3.7 is finally available for download!
Version 3.7 is a big milestone for us for a variety of reasons that all share the same goal, to make Shoko even better for both users and developers. Shoko is open-source for a reason, we want people to contribute, to implement new ideas, fix bugs or even optimize the code. We truly appreciate each and every person that has contributed to the project and want to make it even more easier to do so by addressing some of the issues that have been brought up.</description></item><item><title>JMM is Now Shoko!
